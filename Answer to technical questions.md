1)How long did you spend on the coding test? 
-> I spend more than 2 and a half days on this project.I did this project using REactJS
2)What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
-> The most useful feature was using refs in ReactJS which provide a way to access DOM elements or React components directly without triggering re-renders.
3)How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
-> To track down a performance issue in production for a React-based task manager app, I would follow these steps:
  a) Use browser developer tools like Chrome Devtools to check for slow components.
  b) Look for event listener leaks or unnecessary state updates.
 4) If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
 -> I would make the UI more appealing and attractive and try to deploy the project.
